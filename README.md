# 💧 Thirst Quest – A charity: water Mini Game

**Author:** Kezia Grace West

## Overview

**Thirst Quest** is a browser-based mini game created to support the mission of [charity: water](https://www.charitywater.org/), a nonprofit bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries. This interactive experience was developed as part of a college assignment to raise awareness and engage young people through game-based learning.

The goal? **Collect clean water drops to fill a virtual bucket before time runs out.**

Alongside the game, an **interactive globe widget** visualizes charity: water’s real-world impact across the globe—from deep tube wells in Bangladesh to solar-powered systems in Nigeria—connecting gameplay to tangible outcomes.

## 🛠️ Development Notes

This game was developed during the **Summer 2025 Global Career Accelerator** at the University of Texas at Arlington. The goal: make global water issues **personal and interactive**, bridging game design with real nonprofit impact.

Incorporating map data, score logic, and mobile responsiveness was an opportunity to practice UX empathy and connect user experience to real-world missions.
